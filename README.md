# 🩺 Skin Cancer Detection with Dual-Modality Deep Learning
## 📋 Project Overview

This project presents a deep learning–based skin cancer detection system for multi class skin lesion diagnosis using the MILK10k / ISIC 2025 dataset.
The model jointly analyzes dual modality images clinical close-up and dermoscopic along with patient metadata to classify lesions into 11 diagnostic categories.

By fusing visual features with clinical context, the system improves diagnostic robustness and outputs class wise probability scores, enabling reliable evaluation using the Macro F1 Score on a blind benchmark test set.

Performance Achieved (ISIC MILK10k Challenge):

Accuracy: 75.94%
Macro F1 Score: 0.2572

## 📊 Dataset Summary
### Training Dataset (MILK10k)

Lesions: 5,240
Images: 10,480 JPEG images
1 clinical close-up image per lesion
1 dermatoscopic image per lesion
Metadata entries: 10,480
Supplemental metadata entries: 10,480
Ground truth labels: 5,240 lesion diagnoses

### Benchmark (Test) Dataset

Lesions: 479
Images: 958 JPEG images (clinical + dermoscopic pairs)
Metadata entries: 958
Ground truth: Hidden (used for leaderboard evaluation)


## 🧬 Diagnostic Categories (11 Classes)

Each lesion is classified into one of 11 diagnostic categories, and the model outputs probability scores for all classes.

Abbreviation	Diagnostic Category
AKIEC	Actinic keratosis / intraepidermal carcinoma
BCC	Basal cell carcinoma
BEN_OTH	Other benign proliferations (including collision tumors)
BKL	Benign keratinocytic lesion
DF	Dermatofibroma
INF	Inflammatory and infectious conditions
MAL_OTH	Other malignant proliferations
MEL	Melanoma
NV	Melanocytic nevus
SCCKA	Squamous cell carcinoma / keratoacanthoma
VASC	Vascular lesions and hemorrhage

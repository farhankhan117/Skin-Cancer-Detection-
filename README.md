🩺 Skin Cancer Detection with Dual-Modality Deep Learning
📋 Project Overview

This project presents a deep learning–based skin cancer detection system for multi class skin lesion diagnosis using the MILK10k / ISIC 2025 dataset.
The model jointly analyzes dual modality images clinical close-up and dermoscopic along with patient metadata to classify lesions into 11 diagnostic categories.

By fusing visual features with clinical context, the system improves diagnostic robustness and outputs class wise probability scores, enabling reliable evaluation using the Macro F1 Score on a blind benchmark test set.

Performance Achieved (ISIC MILK10k Challenge):

Accuracy: 75.94%

Macro F1 Score: 0.2572
